# RPM-VersionSort-PP
RPM version sorting algorithm in pure Perl

This is a quick-and-dirty pure Perl reimplementation of Daniel Hagerty's
original XS module
[RPM::VersionSort](https://metacpan.org/release/HAG/RPM-VersionSort-1.00) that wasn't suitable for some
architecture-independent deployment. It's obviously way slower but should be
fine for comapring the occasional version number.

You may use and distribute this software either under the same terms as Perl
itself or under the GNU GPL3, at your choice.
